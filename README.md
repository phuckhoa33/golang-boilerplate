# Golang Project

This repository contains a comprehensive application developed using Go, also known as Golang. Go is a statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming. 

## Project Structure

The codebase is structured following best practices for Go projects, with separate directories for different types of files:

- `main.go`: The entry point of the application.
- `pkg`: This directory contains packages used by the main application.
- `cmd`: This directory contains commands that the application can run.

## Features

The project leverages Go's robust standard library and powerful features to deliver a high-performance application. It includes various components such as data structures, algorithms, and API endpoints, all implemented in Go.

## Testing

Unit tests are an integral part of this project, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code. They are written using Go's built-in testing framework.

## Getting Started

To build, test, and run the application, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `go build` to compile the application.
4. Run `go test` to execute the unit tests.
5. Run `go run main.go` to start the application.

## Documentation

For more information about the project's structure and functionality, refer to the documentation included in the code files.

This project showcases the capabilities of Go as a powerful tool for back-end development, providing a solid foundation for building efficient, reliable, and scalable applications.
